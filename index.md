Deep Learning for Climate Model Emulation

Duncan Watson-Parris 


**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 
The most intresting topic covered in my domain this quarter is probably the dataset I am working with. This is the first time I am working with geospaptial data and seeing machine learning concepts being used to predict rain and average temp is fascinating.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** 
A potential investigation I would like to purse for my quarter 2 checkpoint is trying to do a simulation of a specfic model that I want to use and create a UI visualization that would show us how this certain part of earth would be impacted over a certain time period. I think this would be benefical for teaching and showing the impacts of climate change.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change would be how we optimize the models using different modeling techniques then the ones used in the paper we aim to replicate

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I dont think it is possible but I am interested in implementing agentic workflows as a way to develop a resource for people who may be intersted in learning more about cliamte data and emulation info.
